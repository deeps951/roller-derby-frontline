# 🏁 Roller Derby Frontline

**Fast. Fearless. Fierce.**

A creative showcase website built by **Andrew Cox**, using **Bootstrap 5** and a global **CDN** for lightning-fast delivery.  
This project isn’t just a sample — it’s a statement: design, motion, and storytelling can coexist beautifully on the modern web.

## 💡 About This Project
Roller Derby Frontline is a fictional but lovingly crafted one-page site inspired by the energy and artistry of roller derby.  
It’s designed to demonstrate my front-end development approach:
- Clean structure
- Responsive design
- Purposeful typography
- Subtle yet powerful use of imagery

Every section is built to show both **design taste** and **technical discipline**.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
I approach design the way I approach music and photography:  
focus on **rhythm**, **contrast**, and **human emotion**.  
This site mirrors that philosophy — a blend of grayscale minimalism, bold typography, and energetic accents that echo the spirit of roller derby itself.

---

## 🚀 Deployment
This site is hosted using **GitHub Pages**:
1. Code lives in the main branch  
2. Bootstrap assets load from jsDelivr CDN  
3. Every update is automatically deployed when pushed
